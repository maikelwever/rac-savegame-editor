# Functional parts
 
 - Can load savegames in PS3 format, both decrypted and encrypted.
 - Can load savegames from PS Vita, [in decrypted format](/docs/HOW-TO-MOVE-SAVES-FOR-VITA.md).
 - Can load savegames from PS2 in .bin format (can be obtained using uLaunchELF)
 - Loads supported values from the savegame and shows these in the UI.
 - Write back modified data to savegame for decrypted PS3 and PSVita.


# Currently supported games

This does not denote how many items in the savegame are visible/editable.

 - Ratchet and Clank 1 (OG)
 - Ratchet and Clank 2 (Going Commando)
 - Ratchet and Clank 3 (Up Your Arsenal)
 - Ratchet: Deadlocked / Gladiator
 - Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools Of Destruction
 - Ratchet and Clank Future: Quest For Booty
 - Ratchet and Clank Future: A Crack In Time
 - Ratchet and Clank: Into the Nexus


# Do I need the encrypted or decrypted load button?

 - If you are importing RPCS3 savegames, these are all stored decrypted.
 - If you have decrypted your saves manually (with pfdtool or something similar), use the decrypted button.
 - Else, use the encrypted button. The default encryption key is all 0xFF, and works on unencrypted games as well. 


# Short term roadmap

 - Support all Ratchet games on the PS3.
 - Implement writing for PS2 .bin format, with checksum support
 - Fix encryption writeback for PS3 format savegames.
 - Add as much editable value as currently known.


# Development

The project is written in C# and uses GTK3 via GtkSharp for UI rendering. It expects to be built using .NET Core 2.0.
You can use whatever IDE or editor you like, but one with .sln or .csproj support will be nice to have.

I've used both VS Code, Rider, and Visual Studio in the past.
Alternatively, you can just use your favorite editor, and the `dotnet` command-line tool.

For development of the UI parts, please see the GTK notes below.


## Adding new addresses for values in savegames

I've tried to make it as easy as possible to add new values to edit.
Please see `GameItems.cs` for a list of currently supported items.
You can add new items in the same style as the current definitions.


## Getting GTK on Windows

### For end-users or non-UI developers

The simpelest way to globally install the GTK3 libraries is by using a redist package:
https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer/releases/tag/2019-08-05

Ensure the 'Add to PATH' box is ticked during install, 
and restart your IDE if it was open during the installation process.

### For (UI) developers

The most feature complete way of dealing with GTK3 on Windows is by installing MSYS2.
A small guide is written here: https://www.gtk.org/download/windows.php .

Follow the 'Using GTK from MSYS2 packages' guide, and ensure you install at least:

  - mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3
  - mingw-w64-x86_64-glade
  - mingw-w64-x86_64-devhelp

Afterwards, add the msys2 mingw64 binary path to your system's PATH environment variable, 
and restart open IDE processes. 
For reference, the binary path looks like this: `c:\\msys64\\mingw64\\bin`.

### For bundling in a zip together with the main executable

Most easy is to install the redist package (see above), 
and copy `c:\\Program Files\\GTK3-Runtime Win64\\` to an empty folder.

Build with your favorite build tooling, 
and copy the bin/Debug (or bin/Release) folder contents to the `bin` folder of your previously empty folder.
